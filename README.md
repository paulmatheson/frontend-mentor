## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as a catch-all to my solutions to various Frontend Mentor challenges as I solve and publish them. Feel free to browse and gather inspiration.

[About Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## What are these projects?

The task is to build out the project using the designs inside the `/design` folder as guidance. We are required to build both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that we need to use our best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
